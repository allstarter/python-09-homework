### Homework:
Continue the bank application and add more features like:

* Generating PDF files with [reportlab](https://docs.reportlab.com/demos/hello_world/hello_world/) module \
  You will find example code already in `operations/balance.py` file
* Rework the menu by using [simple-term-menu](https://pypi.org/project/simple-term-menu/) module

> `python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip`
> * Install venv `python -m venv .venv`
> * Enter venv running `.venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
> * Install packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
